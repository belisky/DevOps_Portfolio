# Hello Java...

## Abstract.

### Building Secured Dockerised Java based application using Multistage builds in Docker.

---

### In this project I package a simple Java based application using multistaging in Docker

## Benefits of MultiStage Builds in Docker

- Security: Security is at the heart of any deployed software product. With multi-stage builds in docker, the container obtained comes with just the required packages needed to run your application not with the other packages that are required at compile time, hence a reduced surface of options of exploiting vulnerability.
- Size: Since the Container comes with just the needed packages, the size of the Overall bundle is smaller and lighter which makes it faster to deploy.
