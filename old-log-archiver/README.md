## Abstract.

### Have you ever been in a position where you wished to archive your old Log Files for easy Backup/Data Migration/future reference and saving space simultaneously by running a simple script?

---

### In this project I write a functional bash script(freespace.sh) that helps you archive old log files and helps you save space on your workstation simultaneously.

---

### One step at a time.
